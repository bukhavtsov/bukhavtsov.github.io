    <description><![CDATA[JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Authentication with Golang: A Complete Guide If you&rsquo;re curious about JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or looking to add authentication to your project, then this post is for you. Today, weâ€™ll explore JWT authentication and build an authentication server using Golang. We&rsquo;ll also cover how to connect it with the frontend. By the end of this guide, you&rsquo;ll be equipped to implement JWT for your own projects. So, grab a coffee and let&rsquo;s dive in!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[How to integrate Golang Service with Chat GPT API. Intro In this tutorial we&rsquo;re going to create a Golang service that communicates with Chat GPT API. The source code you can find here. As a result you should be able to understand how to do it and change the logic for implementing your own use cases.
Prerequisites For implementing the solution we need to have:
API Key to Chat GPT API and at the moment Chat GPT doesn&rsquo;t provide free trial, so you&rsquo;ll have to setup your Open API account and pay X per token.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The Incredible Two Pointers Technique Hey there, fellow learners! I&rsquo;m Artem, and today&rsquo;s lesson is all about the incredible Two Pointers technique.
What is the Benefit of the Two Pointers Technique? Before we dive deep into the details, let&rsquo;s first talk about the benefit of the Two Pointers technique. This technique can dramatically improve the performance of your solutions, allowing you to optimize algorithms with time complexities like O(n^2) or O(n log n) down to O(n) in many cases.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hello everybody and welcome back. My name is Artem and in this blog post we&rsquo;re going to understand what does Big O notation mean and consider the time complexity. So, Let&rsquo;s get to it!
Why it&rsquo;s essential to understand and master Big O? First, it allows you to determine the most efficient solution for task that you need to resolve. Secondly, it potentially could help you to optimise an existing solution that you have implemented already.]]></description>
